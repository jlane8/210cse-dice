 This game will, upon user input, roll the dice.
 Each roll will include values for five dice.
 For each 1 rolled, the user will get 100 points.
 For each 5 rolled, the user will get 50 points.
 The user may continue to roll until they get a roll with no points or until they decide to no longer roll.
 If the user rolls and gets neither of these, the user's total score drops to zero and the game is over.
 If the user stops rolling before getting a zero roll, the user's total score is the last total.
